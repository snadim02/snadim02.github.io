Our front entry used to be zero function *AND* zero charm, what a combo. :upside_down_face: I finally fixed the vibe so that guests would think they're walking into our actual home 
instead of accidentally into a (ugly) storage closet. :coat: :scarf: :handbag: :boot:

:construction: **Page Under Construction** :construction:

## Before and Afters

During Covid, we transformed our entryway into a makeshift mudroom to avoid using the 
shared back stairwell. But 
once we [reworked our basement storage unit](../2024-02-01-storage-unit), this space mostly became a guest entrance.

*:point_up: The view when you entered our unit from the shared condo hallway.*

*Ta da!* More welcoming than before, I hope. The art and mirror were relocated from our [old master bedroom](../2025-05-12-kid-bedroom) once we [moved upstairs](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom).

**Problem 1: Tiny Space**
The entryway is *tiny* (7'8" x 3'10" = under 30 feet<sup>2</sup>) with entry through the door and exit up the stairs right next to each other. :potted_plant: :leaves:

I use hooks for keys (check out my whole [ultra-organized key system](../2021-11-10-phone-wallet-keys)! :key:) and minimized any floor furniture. The [faux](https://www.michaels.com/product/hanging-philo-bush-by-ashland-10547222) [plants](https://www.michaels.com/product/green-hanging-eucalyptus-bush-by-ashland-10626930) are in [hanging planters](https://www.wayfair.com/home/pdp/mercury-row-jansen-2-piece-metal-hanging-planter-w004840657.html?piid=812020647) in the corner above head height.

I tried to make the stairwell less... imposing / *prison-y* :fearful:... by adding photos as well! I bought those [29-opening Adeco frames](https://www.amazon.com/Adeco-Decorative-Openings-3-25x2-75-rectangular/dp/B005LJHJFY/) on serious clearance during graduate school, and they are still going strong. :framed_picture:

**Too Much Storage?** We had a shoe bench that housed torn mittens :gloves:, too-small (and forgotten about) seasonal outerwear :scarf: :snowman:, and (most recently) piles of missing toys and books 	:game_die: :teddy_bear: :books: that our younger kiddo had stashed down here then cried about losing! :sob: :expressionless: :woman_facepalming:

## Process

### Relocate electrical junction box?

Our wall sconce has always been off-center, and it always drove me nuts. :face_with_spiral_eyes: I decided to shift it over 4" to where it belonged, and it turns out that my *neighbor's* junction box *is* perfectly centered (and perfectly in the way). 

![Entryway before](../assets/img/entryway-junctionbox.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I found a new [wall sconce with a large baseplate](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJX3MQPX) that I could hang centered but connect to the off-center junction box anyway.

### Peel-and-stick wallpaper

This cheerful wallpaper is called ["Whispers of Chinoiserie" from GiffyWalls](https://www.giffywalls.com/products/whispers-of-chinoiserie-wallpaper), and this was my fourth time installing peel-and-stick wallpaper. First was our [downstairs bathroom](../2022-06-25-bathroom-reno) (2022), then our [master bedroom](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom) and a little project in our [office loft](../2023-06-01-fireplace) (2023), then the [utility room](../2024-06-26-laundry) (2024), and now here! 

![Entryway before](../assets/img/entryway-wallpaper.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Getting around (wavy, uneven) corners is still *the absolute worst*.
