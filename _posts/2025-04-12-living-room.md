Part of our multi-step "Big Move of 2025" required moving our [sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/) from the 
upstairs guest room
into the downstairs living room. Great opportunity to redesign the space for our 
family's next kids-only-no-babies chapter!

## Before

Our living room wasn't *bad* before, it was just bare bones to [accommodate 
tiny babies](../2022-12-30-toys). Since our boys are now *kids*, I thought our living room should 
feel more like the cozy family hangout space that we actually use it for.

## The Design

I decided to try my luck with using [Havenly](https://havenly.com/) to get
some ideas for the space. My designer, [Mercedes Platas](https://havenly.com/interior-designers/mercedes-platas-14289), is a genius, 
and put together a design that incorporated the [sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/), 
existing sofas, and [art from Elena Kotliarker](https://www.elenakotliarker.com/) that I had been eyeing for years.

## The Current Progress

Home takes time. Our living room is now in a semi-stable state, but it will continue
to evolve to meet our changing needs!

the gallery wall!
