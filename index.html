Hi! &#128075; </br></br>

My <a href="research">current research</a> centers around developing computational methods to address
health conditions with suspected genetic underpinnings &horbar; from <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32711844/">cancer</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.13.580158v1">Mendelian disorders</a> to
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.22.23285773v2">unexpected treatment responders</a> &horbar;
where <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33580225/">causative genetic variants remain elusive</a>.
<b>Pinpointing disease-relevant genetic variants that defy detection
    can <em>shine a light on the limits of our biological and medical knowledge</em> and
    requires the development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.07.22283238v1">computationally tractable and interpretable models</a> that
    integrate <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535108/">high-throughput functionality data</a>,
    population-level 'omics data, and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37828001/">clinical health data</a>.</b>

</br></br>
I chair the Tool Building Coalition working group in the
<a target="_blank" href="https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/">Undiagnosed Diseases Network</a>, teach
about genome <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acmgmeeting.net/speakers/shilpa-kobren">sequencing analysis</a>
for <a target="_blank" href="https://cmecatalog.hms.harvard.edu/evaluation-undiagnosed-and-rare-conditions/faculty">rare disease diagnosis</a>,
and mentor and advise undergraduate, Master's, and PhD students on their research projects.

</br></br>
My mental and creative energy is also drawn in many other (rewarding, demanding, typically unacknowledged) directions: I coordinate the Tykes league through
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.somervillesoccer.org/">Somerville Youth Soccer</a>, am a trustee for our
self-managed 6-unit condo (and oversee our budget, legal paperwork, and large construction projects), and am the
parent&ndash;teacher liaison and volunteer coordinator for my eldest kiddo's (public school) classroom.
I love <a href="refactor">DIY house projects</a>, camping and backpacking with my kids, and seeing live music.
