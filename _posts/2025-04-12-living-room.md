Part of our multi-step "Big Move of 2025" required moving our [sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/) from the 
[upstairs guest room](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom)
into the downstairs living room. Great opportunity to redesign the space for our 
family's next kids-only-no-babies chapter! :child: :thumbsup: :baby: :thumbsdown: 

**Skip ahead** to see some (1) *very satisfying* [before & afters](#before--after) :heavy_check_mark:,
(2) the [initial design inspiration](#the-design) :star:, and (3) [fun(ctional) projects](#the-details) in the space :hammer:!

## Before & After

Our living room wasn't *bad* before, it was just bare bones to [accommodate 
tiny babies](../2022-12-30-toys). :baby: Since our boys are now *kids*, :child: I thought our living room should 
feel more like the cozy family hangout space that we actually use it for. :video_game: :books:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-before02.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-header.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Notice that we kept the corner plant :deciduous_tree:, coffee table, couches, and blanket/books 
storage shelf (for now)! The two wall sconces were [removed and replaced](#lighting-in-a-tree) with switch-enabled 
outlets. :bulb:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-before03.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Living Room After (Stairs Angle)](../assets/img/livingroom-after2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

We removed that [great-for-childproofing-tchotchkes wall shelf](https://www.wayfair.com/storage-organization/pdp/zipcode-design-girouard-6-piece-accent-shelf-w004780316.html) because I kept 
hitting my head on it while picking up toys :face_with_head_bandage: :teddy_bear: and because it was blocking us from adding 
curtains to the side window. :window: We moved the plants into [rail-mounted planters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D79J6FYR) :potted_plant: (*aren't they awesome?!*),
but kept the [toys in the same place](../2022-12-30-toys) since it's still the perfect spot for them. :jigsaw: :bricks:

## The Design

My [Havenly](https://havenly.com/) designer, [Mercedes Platas](https://havenly.com/interior-designers/mercedes-platas-14289), is a genius. 
Her design incorporated the [sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/), 
existing sofas, and [art from Elena Kotliarker](https://www.elenakotliarker.com/) that I had been eyeing for years.
I never would have known how good [ochre (yellow) curtains](https://www.target.com/p/brylanehome-poly-cotton-canvas-back-tab-panel---48--w-96--l--ochre/-/A-90050366) 
could look in this room! :heart_eyes:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-design01.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The dimensions weren't *quite* right (probably my mistake), and the sofa table and rug runner (left :point_up:) 
didn't actually fit, but I like the vibe!

## The Details

*Home takes time.* :stopwatch: :house: Our living room is now in a semi-stable state, but I'll continue
to adapt it to fit our family's changing needs! **Keep reading** about my functional solutions

### Evolution of the Gallery Wall 

**Iteration 1.** When my husband and I first moved in together once we were married :ring: :person_with_veil:, we each came with a random assortment of 
artwork from our travels. :cambodia: :egypt: :thailand: :india: :vietnam: :israel: :nepal: :sri_lanka: :iran: :peru: I combined it all into a gallery wall in our first apartment in [Northampton, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton,_Massachusetts) by laying the artwork
out on the floor onto craft paper, tracing the art, then taping the paper to the wall to put nails in. :framed_picture: :hammer:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-gallerywall1.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Iteration 2.** I repeated the process when we moved into our tiny 
[Cambridgeport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeport,_Cambridge,_Massachusetts) 
apartment in 2018. :framed_picture:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-gallerywall2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Iteration 3.** And finally! Here is the gallery wall in our current condo. Hanging
all this over the staircase while keeping our necks intact was... not guaranteed... :ladder: :hammer: :face_with_head_bandage:
This time, I drew level +'s all over the craft paper and measured 40" up from
the stairs in order to lay the art out to arrange. I also changed the wall color from [BM Stokes Forest Green](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/2035-40/stokes-forest-green) 
to [BM Ash Blue](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/2057-40/ash-blue),
which (I think...? :thinking:) works better in this north-facing room. :green_heart: :blue_heart:

### 3D-Printed Furniture Levels

Who knew that the floor in our 1890 condo could *slant so much?!* [I guess I did.](../2023-06-01-fireplace)... :face_with_spiral_eyes:
The front of the sofa in the bay window 
was nearly two inches lower than the back. :couch_and_lamp: **(1)** I tried stacking furniture protector pads, which slid out of place and left sticky residue on the floor. :angry: 
**(2)** *Then* I got [anti-slip furniture casters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018H0NDRG)
and [wobble wedges](https://www.amazon.com/Wobble-Wedges-Rigid-Plastic-Shims/dp/B00435B9FS/?th=1), which were much better but kept collapsing... :shrug:
**(3)** *Finally*, I designed [frames for the wobble wedges on TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/3RbVUoPeB7x-wobble-wedge-holder?sharecode=6Kn_11-EEqJm6C4Hw36rYxwQHIY3BJLc7ZpkYPgI5nE) and 3D printed them in [wood+PLA filament](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088BRY1PN).
Success! :clap:

### Bay Window Curtains

Our [design renderings](#the-design) immediately convinced me that this project was worth it. :star_struck: :tipping_hand_woman:

**Step 1. Planning! (of course)** I taped some [craft paper](https://www.michaels.com/product/paper-roll-by-recollections-24-x-20ft-10683716) to the ceiling of the bay window nook to copy the *exact size and angles*. :ladder: 

**Step 2. Cut once, [curse twice](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/measure_twice_and_cut_once#English)?** :woman_facepalming:
I used my [tabletop saw with metal-cutting blade](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P6GZN5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to cut the [curtain rods](https://www.target.com/p/36-34-66-34-cap-curtain-rod-oil-rubbed-bronze-threshold-8482/-/A-54567180) to size (accounting for the wall-to-rod distance of the 
[curtain hooks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XYBQK7Y)), and connected the angles using these clever [angle connectors](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZCCKPT2). :triangular_ruler: :hook:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-curtains.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Step 3. Marvel at accomplishment.** *Ta da!* :window: :clap:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-curtains2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Lighting in a Tree

I had two (annoyingly placed) wall sconces removed and replaced with switch-operated outlets. The plant corner was too dark, though, 
so I installed [four Shepherd's hooks](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0881LM5Z1) directly into the [plant pot](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CTD9SDS) and strung up 
[pendant light sockets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJN9KVR). :deciduous_tree: 
I [experimented](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBPFFTNJ) with 
[different](https://www.amazon.com/Gozelux-Equivalent-Dimmable-Brightness-Filament/dp/B0CLC8XRT4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa) 
[bulbs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZJ9V7XJ), and finally settled on 
[*low wattage, frosted bulbs*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919JKD7F) that diffuse light :sparkle:, 
aren't blindingly bright at eye level :sunglasses:, and still look okay exposed during the daytime. :bulb:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-plantlight.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Soundproofing the Staircase

We live in a condo unit above and next to others. The neighbor who shares a wall
with us [could hear every step we took](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/q20db4/best_way_to_soundproof_your_townhouse_from/) up and down the stairs. :ear: :hear_no_evil:
I'm aware of very few [effective solutions for dampening impact noise](https://www.tmsoundproofing.com/understanding-impact-footstep-noise.html). :cityscape:
In a show of good faith, I installed [polyester](https://unikavaev.com/blog/guide-to-sound-absorbing-acoustic-rugs/) [stair treads](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR1F82LS) and added [acoustic panels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CK83HPW) to the 
backs of our stairwell art anyway. This (unsurprisingly) 
made no difference for our neighbor,
but it helped reduce [*our* perception of external noise](https://www.soundproofcow.com/application/residental-diy/)! :loud_sound: :loudspeaker:

![Living Room](../assets/img/livingroom-soundproof.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Cost

Did I intend to redo the living room this year? *Nope.*
Remember that we were already installing a 
[custom wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe) and redoing the 
[master bedroom](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom) and my [kiddo's bedroom](../2025-05-12-kid-bedroom) during the **Big Move of 2025**... :money_with_wings: 

However, once I heard the quote for moving 
the sleeper sofa (see below), I realized that it was *now or never* to replace the [area rug](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CJ64MD5), since we'd never move that 
couch again. The process snowballed into changing up the entire room. :shrug: 

Here's one last "after" pic, though, to convince you (/me?!) that it was *all worth it!* :heart_eyes:
