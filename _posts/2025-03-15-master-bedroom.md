We recently moved our bedroom upstairs into a room that already functioned as 
an office :computer: :printer: 
*and* music room :banjo: :musical_keyboard: :accordion: :violin:. A dramatic reworking of the space was necessary
to accommodate these *triple utilities* while maintaining a calm, sleep-inducing retreat :bed: :sleeping:. 

**Jump ahead to see**
(1) the [transition from guest to master bedroom](#guest--master-bedroom-transition) :couch_and_lamp: :bed:,
(2) [office organization](#office-organization) :pencil: :pen:, and
(3) [music organization](#music-organization) :musical_score: :studio_microphone:.

## Room 1: The Master Bedroom

We originally had this side of the room set up as a guest bedroom with a [pullout sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/).

![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-officebefore.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

To transition this space into a master bedroom, we moved our actual bed upstairs
and the sleeper sofa [downstairs into the living room](../2025-04-12-living-room). :couch_and_lamp: :bed:

![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-after2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Nightstands.** I sold the [old sofa side tables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BLVPG6BV) and 
[wall sconces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4J8V625) :money_mouth_face: (lol, yeah right) 
and replaced them with a [side cabinet](https://www.target.com/p/withania-2-door-cabinet-threshold-8482/-/A-89207299) and 
[nightstand](https://www.overstock.com/products/safavieh-shyann-single-door-carved-nightstand-40656766?variant=61943056466079) with more practical storage 
and [swivel-arm wall sconces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087T4ZY8N) that we already owned. :bulb:

**Aesthetic Accessories.** My [jewelry](../2025-03-01-wardrobe/#organization) and [scarves](../2025-07-15-scarves)
didn't fit in our [custom wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe) :prayer_beads: :scarf:, so I 
hung them out here for easy access. Bonus benefit! :star_struck: They look nice displayed like this! 
:framed_picture:

*And check out the view from bed.* :point_down:
![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-after.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Not bad for functionally hiding office clutter to actually fall asleep at night! :relieved: :sleeping:

## Room 2: The Office

### Standing Desk
The **standing desk** had to go on the *only wall without a sloping ceiling*. 
:desktop_computer: :keyboard: :computer_mouse: I reduced
[stressful tech clutter](https://www.housedigest.com/1438812/david-bromstad-hgtv-home-office-bedroom/) 
by installing [monitor posts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLHMFGX) and 
[drilling](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/tools/power-tool-accessories/hole-saws/2029552) [grommet holes for wires](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G83N99D). 
:see_no_evil:

![Picture of Standing Desk](../assets/img/masterbed-desk.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Printers
How sneaky is this!? I hid the [**3D printer**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-semi-assembled-3d-printer-4/) inside 
the [office credenza](https://www.wayfair.com/organization-storage/pdp/loon-peak-bettye-1-drawer-credenza-w004342388.html) 
on a slide-out printer tray blocked with [café curtains](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLGTVHPF). :ninja: :star_struck:

![Master Bedroom 3D Printer](../assets/img/masterbed-3dprinter.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
:point_up: *The printer works perfectly while tucked away, 
and the curtain [blocks drafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1agk4aw/is_there_any_problem_of_leaving_my_3d_printer_in/), too!*

Our regular **laserjet printer** is also hidden in the middle section of 
the office credenza, 
and I arranged my paper types for easier DIY labeling. :printer:

![Master Bedroom Hidden Printer](../assets/img/masterbed-hiddenprinter.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### File Storage

Guess who's [no longer pointlessly holding onto](https://shiragill.com/paperwork-organization-simplified/) 12-year-old rental leases?! 
Me!! :raising_hand_woman: ...As of two weeks ago. :grimacing:
I whittled down an enormous 2-drawer file cabinet of junk into this 
single crate. :file_cabinet:

![Master Bedroom File Crate](../assets/img/masterbed-files.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Office Supplies

Our other office supplies are organized and 
labeled in the top drawer of the office credenza 
(using these [fantastic interlocking drawer organizers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DAQ73P0))... :pen: :pencil: :pushpin:

![Master Bedroom Office Supplies](../assets/img/masterbed-officesupplies.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

...and in the
[bedside cabinet](https://www.target.com/p/withania-2-door-cabinet-threshold-8482/-/A-89207299) 
(using these [clear bins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DFBSTFR), which I also use 
for [kids' art supplies](../2022-09-01-kids-artwork) and [toy organization](../2022-12-30-toys)). :notebook: :computer_mouse: :video_game:

![Master Bedroom Office Supplies](../assets/img/masterbed-officesupplies2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

*A note about borrowed board games* (see above :point_up:). I like to keep borrowed items within sight (but out of the
way), so that I don't forget to return things when I'm finished! Turns out [loaning out and getting back borrowed items](https://www.reddit.com/r/questions/comments/1j40e9w/whose_responsibilty_is_it_to_return_borrowed_items/)
is a constant AITAH Reddit-thread topic... :thinking: :neutral_face:

## Room 3: The Music Room 

You probably [saw](#guest--master-bedroom-transition) the banjo :banjo: and digital piano :musical_keyboard: already. 

![Master Bedroom Digital Piano](../assets/img/masterbed-music1.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I found a [stand for our digital piano on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1664543133/mid-century-modern-piano-keyboard-stand) (*not* that I recommend it) and a [piano bench](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJ4DW86)
to store music. :point_down:  

![Master Bedroom Sheet Music](../assets/img/masterbed-openbench.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Organizing printed sheet music in these [sheet music organizers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R8SW845) has been a game changer.

![Master Bedroom Sheet Music](../assets/img/masterbed-sheetmusic.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Banjo *accoutrements* are also now tucked away (hidden, accessible, dust-free) in 
a pretty jewelry box that I was no longer using (because of my 
[gorgeous jewelry drawer](../2025-03-01-wardrobe#3-jewelry)). :banjo:

![Master Bedroom Banjo](../assets/img/masterbed-banjoacc.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

:eyes: You probably *didn't see* the accordion and digital piano travel case that fit under the 
bed out of sight (but within reach). :accordion: :musical_keyboard: 

![Master Bedroom Accordion](../assets/img/masterbed-accordion.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Our recording equipment :studio_microphone: :headphones: and amplifier :radio:
are now stored in the bedside tables, also accessible and out of sight. *We did it!* 

## Cost

After I moved my [workspace out to the loft](../2023-06-01-fireplace) in 2023, I felt bad for my husband's (*relatively super ugly*)
office space, and so I prettied-up the room for the first time then. 

Here are prices for the *new* design for our master bedroom, but I include costs from that former redesign separately below.
