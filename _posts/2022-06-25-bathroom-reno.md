Ah, the joys and horrors of **POTTY TRAINING** !!! Let me tell you what is **NOT** going to work: 
A bathroom that the kids... :x: can't access, :x: can't turn the light on for, and :x: can't wash/dry their hands in. 
(Plus anyway this bathroom was gross and weird.)

### The problems: too many to list?!
* Floor grout is crumbly and stinks
* Bathroom vanity has a single sink (that the door nearly hits when opening)
* Toilet is behind said door (can't be accessed until door is closed)
* No kid-reachable towel bar/hook
* No kid-reachable light switch
* No spot for a stool
* Windowless white bathrooms can start to feel... dingy.

***Check it out now!** Replaced the floor, toilet, vanity, and mirror (and added hooks, towel bars, and peel and stick wallpaper).
Also added this clever [light switch extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKJY5Z4) (out of frame of this pic), and 
can slide the stepstool right under the wall-mounted vanity.*

### Organizational treats
...of course.

**(Unbelievably ideal) drawers.** There are *four ridiculously practical* drawers in this 
[Ikea Godmorgon vanity](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/godmorgon-bathroom-vanity-with-4-drawers-high-gloss-white-30344096/) 
with [double sinks](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/odensvik-double-bowl-sink-80148328/) that I was able to fit *everything we needed* into.

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom3.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
**Travel toiletries.** I cleaned up my *super annoying and inefficient* pile of (mostly empty) TSA-sized toiletries
and organized everything else so that I can quickly grab what I need when traveling. Time to pack toiletries for a family (flight) trip is now <5 minutes.

**Medicine cabinet.** The only way to actually SEE what you HAVE! 

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom5.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Yet again, I have found a use for the [Ikea Glis boxes](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/glis-box-with-lid-clear-40466148/): this time to organize cough/cold meds and drops, bandaids, and miscellaneous
wound care supplies.*

### The BEFORE pics
Cringe.

*You can see the [light switch extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKJY5Z4) reflected in the mirror!*

### Cost & time breakdown

To be honest, this bathroom was one of those "keep iterating to make it better" projects that truly occurred over nearly a full
year. But the active work time (sans all the thinking) was under two weeks.
