The phrase "tech debt" refers to the unavoidable cost of future maintenance or 
reworking of a (software) system where speed/hacks 
were prioritized over quality during development. 
Do we have a similar phrase for a catch-all "junk" space in our homes? 

Our laundry room supposedly doubled as a utility room where my tools and spare parts were stashed, but it turns out I could never find
what I needed when I needed it! We all know by now that I am not a fan of inefficiency. 

*Details to come, but I'll leave you with some before-and-after shots for now!*
