Hi! &#128075;

<br><br>

My <a href="research">current research</a> centers around developing computational methods to
uncover <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33580225/"><em>elusive</em> genetic underpinnings</a>
of human health conditions such as <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32711844/">cancer</a>,
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.13.580158v1">Mendelian disorders</a>, and
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.22.23285773v2">unexpected treatment responders</a>.
<b>Pinpointing disease-relevant genetic variants that defy detection
    can <em>shine a light on the limits of our biological and medical knowledge</em></b> and
    requires the development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.07.22283238v1">computationally tractable and interpretable models</a> that
    integrate <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30535108/">high-throughput functionality data</a>,
    population-level 'omics data, and <a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37828001/">clinical health data</a>.

<br><br>

I chair the Tool Building Coalition working group in the
<a target="_blank" href="https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/">Undiagnosed Diseases Network</a>, teach
about genome <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acmgmeeting.net/speakers/shilpa-kobren">sequencing analysis</a>
for <a target="_blank" href="https://cmecatalog.hms.harvard.edu/evaluation-undiagnosed-and-rare-conditions/faculty">rare disease diagnosis</a>,
and mentor and advise undergraduate, Master's, and PhD students on their research projects.

<br><br>

My mental and creative energy is also drawn in many other (rewarding, demanding, typically unacknowledged) directions:
I'm a great <a href="blog">DIY home organizer</a> (if I don't say so myself :sweat_smile:). I coordinate the Tykes/Pre-K leagues
for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.somervillesoccer.org/">Somerville Youth Soccer</a> &#9917;, am trustee for our
self-managed 6-unit condo (and manage our budget &#128184;, all legal paperwork &#128221;, large construction projects &#127959;, and neighbor disputes &#128495;), and am the
parent&ndash;teacher liaison and volunteer coordinator for my eldest kiddo's (public school) classroom &#128218;.
I love camping and backpacking with my kids &#9978; and seeing live music &#127928;!
