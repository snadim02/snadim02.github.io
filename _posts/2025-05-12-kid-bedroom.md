Perhaps my most controversial purge decision yet... I demoed the only closet in our
kiddo's soon-to-be bedroom. :scream: In my defense, (American) closets are just an [opportunity for
hoarding junk](https://civicscience.com/many-americans-ready-to-purge-their-closets/) :teddy_bear: :package:, and this 
particular closet totally crushed the flow of the room. :face_with_spiral_eyes:

**Jump ahead to see** the [argument for axing the closet](#why-axe-the-closet),
[before and after pictures](#before--afters), [construction process](#the-process), and all the [functional details](#the-details)!

## Why axe the closet?

In the **original layout**, the main door opened into a wall. :no_entry:
The swing-open closet doors crushed the square footage, and replacing them with
sliding doors made accessing the closet frustrating. I also cannot stand having 
your [back to the main door](https://www.thespruce.com/feng-shui-lucky-directions-for-desk-or-bed-3975235#:~:text=Avoid%20Certain%20Positions,and%20creativity%20in%20your%20work) when at the desk. *We can do better.* :muscle: 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kid_bedroom_layout.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

In the **new layout**, the bed is tucked against [the east wall](https://redlotusletter.com/the-east-corner-of-health-growth-and-family/)
into a darker corner of the room. :sleeping: :moon: The 
[view from all other seats](https://www.newsweek.com/feng-shui-expert-furnish-room-command-position-1602833) is also much better! There is still the potential for underbed 
storage, and I found a [great dresser](#dresserwardrobe) for clothes. :shirt:

> While planning this room, I discovered 
> [Cliff Tan's "Feng Shui Modern"](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/feng-shui-modern-9781526639998/),
> which validated what "felt right" and provided a fantastic framework for spatial arrangement! :lotus_position: :yin_yang: :relieved:

## Before & Afters

I wanted the room to vibe with our [newly redecorated living room](../2025-04-12-living-room). *Mission accomplished!* :rocket: :yellow_heart: :blue_heart:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-before2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-after1b.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And here's the side with the (former) closet. We moved our clothes into a 
[custom wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe)
upstairs in the 
[new master bedroom](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom). Our kid's clothes are in his [new dresser](#activity-2-getting-dressed)! :shirt: :jeans: :necktie:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-before1.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-after3.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*:point_up: And yes, those [stars glow in the dark](#glow-in-the-dark-stars)!*

## The Process

**Step 1: Soundproofing.** The walls were empty/thin enough to hear someone rolling over in bed between the bedrooms. :ear:
We added [Rockwool soundproofing insulation](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/ROCKWOOL-Safe-n-Sound-3-in-x-15-1-4-in-x-47-in-Soundproofing-and-Fire-Resistant-Stone-Wool-Insulation-Batt-59-7-sq-ft-RXSS31525/202531875)
on the leftmost wall (bordering the kitchen), followed by [1 lb mass loaded vinyl](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Technoflex-4-ft-x-10-ft-x-1-8-in-1-lb-Technowall-Mass-Loaded-Vinyl-Soundproofing-Barrier-Acoustic-Wall-MLV104810/325283436)
and finished up with [new plaster](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/plaster-vs-drywall-explained). 
The other interior (drywall) walls got 
[cellulose blown-in insulation](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Greenfiber-25-lbs-Cellulose-Blown-In-Insulation-or-Spray-Applied-Insulation-INSSANC/311574454). :hear_no_evil: :shushing_face:

**Step 2: Floor patching.** Matching the hardwood to patch the floor was the most annoying. 
Luckily, contractors who demoed the [upstairs closet to make space for our wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe)
pulled up some of the hardwood that we were able to patch in here.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom02.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Step 3: (Re)painting.** Turns out, *plaster needs to cure*
before it can be painted, and [special primer](https://www.wickes.co.uk/Wickes-Trade-Matt-Emulsion-Paint-for-New-Plaster---Pure-Brilliant-White---10L/p/122443) needs to be used. Even [high quality painter's tape](https://www.frogtape.com/products/delicate-surface-painters-tape) will still 
rip off paint if the first paint coat doesn't cure long enough! *...Ask me how I know...* :roll_eyes: :woozy_face:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-paint.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## The Details

Our kiddo uses his space for three activities: [(1) sleeping](#activity-1-sleeping), 
[(2) getting dressed](#activity-2-getting-dressed), and 
[(3) working on projects](#activity-3-working-on-projects) in peace. :boy:

### Activity 1: Sleeping

**Shades.** I had already installed [light-filtering cellular shades](https://www.selectblinds.com/cellular-shades/light-filtering-cordless-cellular-shades.html) 
when we first moved in. I bought 
[blackout ochre curtains](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXRNCZFR) and had them 
hemmed and narrowed to fit the little
window nook. 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-shades.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

<a name="glow-in-the-dark-stars"></a>
**Glow-in-the-Dark Stars.** NGL, the '90s had something going for it design-wise: [glow-in-the-dark stars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0085092R4)!!! :star: :star2: 
My kid *loves them*, and they fade after about 15-25 minutes so they don't keep him up at night. Putting these up is not for the faint of heart, though... you have to stick adhesive 
putty on each one individually... :unamused: :face_exhaling: 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-stars.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Camouflaged Utility Covers.** 
The [extension cord](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPKKMPBD) tangled up in fitted sheets and the 
bed frame, so I installed [cable covers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZQXRQK) and wall-mounted 
the [outlet block](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPKKMPBD). :electric_plug:
I used [Samplize peel-and-stick color swatches](https://samplize.com/products/lucerne-af-530-12x12?variant=39756341837926) to 
cover the cable covers in [Benjamin Moore Lucerne](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/af-530/lucerne). 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-cablecover.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I'll admit... this was extra. :shrug: I covered the switchplates the same way, because... why not? 
I didn't need to sand/prime/paint anything, and we can easily change up the color (if ever needed).

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-switchplate01.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Ah, so satisfying... :lotus_position:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-switchplate02.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}



### Activity 2: Getting Dressed

*But where will he hang his clothes!?!* :scream: Since I demoed the closet, I needed some way to 
store our kid's clothes. 

**Step 1: Set the bar.** Our son's clothes were previously stored in labeled 
[Ikea Trofast bins](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/trofast-storage-combination-with-boxes-white-white-s29228470/), 
which were 
intuitive for him to use and fantastic for promoting independence. 
I needed something just as organized. :shirt: :jeans:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser1.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Step 2: Find a solution.** I searched *forever* for smallish furniture with hanging space. They're called
"[chifforobes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chifforobe)" or 
"[gentlemen's chests](https://www.dutchcrafters.com/blog/things-to-know-about-a-gentlemans-chest/#:~:text=A%20gentleman's%20chest%20is%20so,hanging%20clothes%20beside%20the%20drawers.)" if you were wondering.

**Step 3: Now find it within budget.** I finally found exactly what I needed on FB Marketplace!
The original furniture was from the 80s, so I thoroughly cleaned it :soap:, 
used [Paraffin wax](https://www.starmarket.com/shop/product-details.960315684.html) to smooth the drawer slides, 
and modernized the look by adding [black handles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09K3PW3N8) to match the [nightstand](https://havenly.com/products/details/Gabrietta-2-Drawer-Nightstand-Medium-Oak-Black-Safavieh-Couture-151813266) I bought.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser3.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Step 4: Arrange clothes!** The cabinet has a pull-out rod for hanging clothes, 
and I added a couple of hooks to the door for hanging sweatshirts.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser4.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I also found perfectly-sized [clothes bins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3DSQ5Z1) to separate the drawers.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser6.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I discuss the pros of file-folding clothes in my 
[post about our (grown-up, built-in) wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe). My kid likes to access his clothes like 
this, but he's working on being able to put them away, too... 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-dresser5.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Activity 3: Working on Projects

**Desk.** A [sturdy workbench](https://havenly.com/products/details/Workbench-Rolling-Workbenches-For-Garage-Adjustable-Height-Wayfair-143767843) 
is WAY more functional for art projects, crafts, and Lego building than a traditional desk. 
You can also adjust the height as kids grow and eventually use it for homework and/or a computer.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-desk.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Bulletin Board.** And where can he hang those art creations when he's done? A [bulletin board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GYQ88L9), of course!! The basic wood frame
was too *grown-up* for a *6-year-old* (in my and his opinion), so I painted it with 
red acrylic paint and sealed it with 
polyurethane. :art: :artist: *How fun!*

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-bulletinboard.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Hanging Planter.** Our kiddo wanted a plant on his desk, but I didn't want to waste precious
surface space for a pot that might get knocked over. 

Apparently [this fantastic color](https://vintageunscripted.com/10-decades-of-color-the-1970s/#:~:text=The%201970s%20was%20the%20first%20great%20houseplant%20collecting%20era) is *vintage 70s*, 
which I'm starting to realize is my favorite decade for design. 🪩 :man_dancing:
The [macramé hanger](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1269880196/no-tassel-macrame-plant-hanger-in-colors?variation0=2803425809&variation1=2836434719) was shorter than I expected, 
so I drilled holes through
some [wooden craft balls](https://www.michaels.com/product/wood-head-beads-by-creatology-10334889) and strung them onto the 
hanger to lengthen it. 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-planthanger.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**All in all, a pretty (fun)ctional new, big-kid room!** :star_struck:
