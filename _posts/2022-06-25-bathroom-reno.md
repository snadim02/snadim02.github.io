Ah, the joys and horrors of **POTTY TRAINING** !!! Let me tell you what is **NOT** going to work: 
A bathroom where the kids can't... :x: access the toilet, :x: turn the light on/off, or :x: wash/dry their hands. 
(Plus anyway this bathroom was gross and weird.)

### The problems: too many to list?!
* Floor grout is crumbly and stinks
* Only one sink in the vanity (that the door nearly hits when opening)
* Toilet is behind said door (can't be accessed until door is closed)
* No kid-reachable towel bar/hook
* No kid-reachable light switch
* No spot for a stool
* Windowless white bathrooms can start to feel... dingy.

**Check it out now!** I replaced the 
[floor](https://www.homedepot.com/p/MSI-Alexandra-White-12-in-x-24-in-Matte-Porcelain-Marble-Look-Floor-and-Wall-Tile-16-sq-ft-Case-NHDALEX12X24/316823076), 
[toilet](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Gerber-Avalanche-Two-Piece-1-28-GPF-Single-Flush-Elongated-ADA-Toilet-in-White-with-Slow-Close-Seat-GWS31818S/326990887), 
[vanity](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/godmorgon-bathroom-vanity-with-4-drawers-high-gloss-white-30344096/), 
and [mirror](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/godmorgon-mirror-cabinet-with-2-doors-mirror-glass-10304355/) 
(and added [hooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008K4O52M), [towel bars](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Nameeks-General-Hotel-14-2-in-Wall-Mounted-Towel-Bar-in-Chrome-Nameeks-NCB09/306181637), and [peel and stick wallpaper](https://www.spoonflower.com/en/wallpaper/10321351-water-blue-silver-by-ceciliamok)).
Now the kids can slide their stepstool right under the wall-mounted vanity.

I also added this clever [light switch extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKJY5Z4) for the kids to reach the light (out of frame of this pic).

### Organizational treats...of course

There are *four ridiculously practical* drawers in this 
[Ikea Godmorgon vanity](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/godmorgon-bathroom-vanity-with-4-drawers-high-gloss-white-30344096/) 
with [double sinks](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/odensvik-double-bowl-sink-80148328/) that I was able to fit *everything we needed* into.

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a closeup. I cleaned up my inefficient pile of (mostly empty) TSA-sized toiletries
and organized what was left so that I can quickly grab what I need when traveling. Time to pack toiletries for a family (flight) trip is now <5 minutes.

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom3.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Medicine cabinets, IMO, are the only way to actually SEE what you HAVE! I refuse to store toiletries in deep cabinets (anymore), and since then, I rarely forget about or misplace (expensive) makeup, lotion, shampoos, etc.!

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom4.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Yet again, I have found a use for the [Ikea Glis boxes](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/glis-box-with-lid-clear-40466148/). This time they're being used to organize cough/cold meds and drops, bandaids, and miscellaneous
wound care supplies.

### Before :anguished: and After :heart_eyes:

Remember all the problems I listed at the top of this post? :disappointed:

![bathroom](../assets/img/bathroom6.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Our renovated bathroom is so much better for our family! (Btw, you can see the [light switch extender](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HKJY5Z4) reflected in the mirror.)

### Cost & time breakdown

To be honest, this bathroom is one of those "keep iterating to make it better" projects that truly occurred over nearly a full
year. But the active work time (sans all the thinking) was under two weeks.
