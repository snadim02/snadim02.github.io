I used to keep spare sheets and towels in [our laundry room](../2024-09-20-laundry) (like a normal person) until detergent dripped 
all over them one day... :sob: Relocating our linens wasn't obvious, since bedroom 
closets are less accessible, and we don't have a linen closet. I needed a unique solution! :bulb:

***Check it out!*** I installed two of these [Ikea STÃ„LL shoe cabinets](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/staell-shoe-cabinet-with-4-compartments-white-60530266/) directly to the hallway wall. 
(They're [available in oak veneer now](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/staell-shoe-cabinet-with-4-compartments-oak-veneer-40530229/), which I totally would have gotten instead.) 
[My sister](https://www.nadimpallilab.org/) insists they look like mailboxes. :mailbox_closed: :raised_eyebrow:

*Then* I filled the compartments with [queen sheets](https://www.brooklinen.com/collections/organic-sheets) (x2), king sheets (for the [upstairs pull-out couch](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/)), 
car blankets (baby blankets used them for nighttime car rides), [beach towels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMDN5MM/) (these dry so nicely), 
beach blankets, hooded bath towels (other bath towels are in [our bathroom](../2022-06-25-bathroom-reno)), and exercise towels.

*Last step* was labeling (of course). I wanted something discreet, so I printed labels onto [transparencies](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B091BVB3GF) and taped them on with [shipping tape](https://www.amazon.com/Scotch-Heavy-Packaging-Inches-Clear/dp/B00RSB6I1E).

As a bonus, keeping linens in the hallway seems to help with dampening noise! :runner: :hear_no_evil: *No regrets with this solution!* :grinning:
