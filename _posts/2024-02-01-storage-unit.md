Our storage unit in the shared, unfinished basement of our 1890 condo had turned into a **dark, scary** dumping ground for stuff we *didn't
need* (but didn't want to deal with) and a whole bunch of stuff *we did need* but couldn't access! Our need to convert our storage unit into usable space was desperate.

### Constraints
* nothing stored against the (damp, dusty) walls
* nothing stored directly on the (floodable, dusty) floor
* floor storage units are tricky because of the uneven, crumbly floors
* wall storage units are tricky because there are no actual walls, and the exposed "studs" are >18" apart
* everything sealed because of said dampness, dust, and silverfish (ew!)

### Storage Requirements
* space for 2 adult and 2 child bicycles
* easy access to:
  * scooters, kids' bikes & helmets
  * soccer balls and nets
  * outdoor toys (chalk, rocket launchers, bubbles, cars, cornhole)
  * bike pump
  * bike trailer and kids' bike seat attachment
  * bug spray, bike lights, bike repair tools
* organized storage for:
  * holiday accessories
  * car camping (tents, tarps, chairs, cookware & stove, sleeping pads & bags)
  * sentimental items (cards, kids' art and toys)
  * backpacking gear
  * beach stuff

*We could not find anything (nor even walk around) in our storage unit. It would be a huge undertaking just to clear out
 the mess before thinking about optimal ways to organize what we did need.*

It occurred to me that our problem is a widely-cited reason for folks with kids to ditch urban living and move to the 'burbs for *space* (like a *garage*).
:anguished: Not for me! I spent several post-kids-bedtime evenings over the course of two months heading down to our storage unit to take
measurements and scour the internet for inspiration pictures and products that might meet our requirements.

Here is how the space looks now:

*HUGE IMPROVEMENT! :heart_eyes: :relaxed:*

## The Process

After deciding on the solution, I ordered everything I (thought) I'd need in advance. My parents watched my 2- and 4-year-old
for ~36 hours over the weekend, and that was my timeframe constraint to finish *all construction*.

![Storage unit](../assets/img/storageunit03.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
***Step 1:** moving not only **our junk** out of the unit, but also relocating **everyone else's junk** that had been blocking access to our unit.*

**The floor:** We first laid down these
[interlocking deck tiles](https://www.homedepot.com/p/326396808). We didn't realize how uneven the floor was until we
moved all of our stuff out, and so we had to fill in giant ditches with some foam mats. *(TBD if that was a good idea...)* I borrowed a circular saw and
tabletop jigsaw to cut the tiles to fit into corners, against the 130-year-old stackstone foundation, and around support posts.

*Here's my only picture before loading everything back in (so you can see the floor).*

**The shelves:** The lack of drywall and nonstandard stud spacing limited our options here for heavy-duty, wall mounted shelves.
The only option that seemed flexible enough to fit our space was this [Everbilt heavy-duty wire frame](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-6-ft-x-20-in-Heavy-Duty-Wire-Shelf-90257/314183866)
system where we could cut the 12' shelves to size with a [bolt cutter](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Milwaukee-18-in-Bolt-Cutter-with-3-8-in-Maximum-Cut-Capacity-48-22-4018/312620426) and had flexibility where the vertical rails needed to be attached to the studs. In my opinion, this is overpriced
for what it is (but was the only option that *maximized* our space within our constraints).

![Storage unit](../assets/img/storageunit04.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The shelves spanned the maximum width of the unit to take advantage of every last inch. No vertical supports in front of the shelves
gave me more flexibility for bin size and enables everyone to access and put away things as easily as possible.*

**The slat wall:** The only way all four bikes were going to fit in our storage unit was with vertical storage. I went with the
[Proslat system](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Proslat-PVC-Slatwall-8-ft-x-4-ft-White-88102/203496104) because I could cut the slats to size and we would also be able to
[hang helmets and the bike pump](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Proslat-Slatwall-4-in-Hooks-12-Pack-13002/204743455) with the [hanging bikes](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Proslat-Slatwall-Vertical-Bike-Hook-2-Pack-13028/204743464).

![Storage unit](../assets/img/storageunit08.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Turns out we needed to add some vertical support to the framing for the slats to be able to take the weight of the bikes. It was snowing during construction day, but it was the only time we had to get the project done!*

![Storage unit](../assets/img/storageunit05.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Check it out! How cute is that little 14-inch-bike and the balance bike? In truth, the kids can't get their bikes on and off this storage (yet). We **can** walk into the storage unit though to get and put them away now, though!*

## Getting rid of stuff

You might be surprised to learn that the *biggest and most time-consuming* part of this project was actually getting rid of stuff that we absolutely did not need!
I made trips to our [local recycling center](https://www.cambridgema.gov/services/recyclingcenter) to get rid of broken appliances and spare metal parts.
I drove out to Roxbury over two nights to recycle scrap wood and warped wood risers at a [construction debris dropoff](https://resourcewasteservices.com/our-facilities/resource-roxbury/) site.
I sold extra wall and flooring tiles on FB Marketplace and gave away unused furniture (folding chairs, carts), baby items and so many other things on the [FB Buy Nothing Cambridge](https://www.facebook.com/groups/476638806418590) group.
I drove to Ikea to return unused items from our pantry and bathroom remodel.
I donated our extra paint to a local [Somerville theater group](https://www.theatreatfirst.org/). My proudest moment of this project is that **nothing ended up in the trash.**

## Final touches

*Shelves reloaded with organized, labeled bins!*

I'll finish this post later with details for exactly why this space is so perfectly organized now (and a total cost breakdown)!
