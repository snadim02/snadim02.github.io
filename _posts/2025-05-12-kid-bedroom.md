Perhaps my most controversial purge decision yet... I demoed the only closet in our
kiddo's soon-to-be bedroom. :scream: In my defense, (American) closets are just an [opportunity for
hoarding junk](https://civicscience.com/many-americans-ready-to-purge-their-closets/) :teddy_bear: :package:, and this 
particular closet totally crushed the flow of the room. :face_with_spiral_eyes:

## :construction: **Page (and also the room! :zany_face:) under construction** :construction:

**Jump ahead to see** the [argument for axing the closet](#why-axe-the-closet),
[before and after pictures](#before--afters), [construction process](#the-process), and all the [artsy details](#the-details)!

## Why axe the closet?

In the **original layout**, the main door opened into a wall. :no_entry:
The swing-open closet doors crushed the square footage, and replacing them with
sliding doors made accessing the closet frustrating. I also cannot stand having 
your [back to the main door](https://www.thespruce.com/feng-shui-lucky-directions-for-desk-or-bed-3975235#:~:text=Avoid%20Certain%20Positions,and%20creativity%20in%20your%20work) when at the desk. *We can do better.* :muscle: 

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kid_bedroom_layout.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

In the **new layout**, the bed is tucked against [the east wall](https://redlotusletter.com/the-east-corner-of-health-growth-and-family/)
into a darker corner of the room. :sleeping: :moon: The 
[view from all other seats](https://www.newsweek.com/feng-shui-expert-furnish-room-command-position-1602833) is also much better! There is still the potential for underbed 
storage, and I found a [great dresser](#dresserwardrobe) for clothes. :shirt:

> which validated what "felt right" and provided a fantastic framework for spatial arrangement! :lotus_position: :yin_yang: :relieved:

## Before & Afters

I wanted the room to vibe with our [newly redecorated living room](../2025-04-12-living-room). *Mission accomplished!* :rocket: :yellow_heart: :blue_heart:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-before2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-after1b.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

And here's the side with the (former) closet. We moved our clothes into a 
[custom wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe)
upstairs in the 
[new master bedroom](../2025-03-15-master-bedroom). Our kid's clothes are in his [new dresser](#dresserwardrobe)! :shirt: :jeans: :necktie:

## The Process

**Step 1: Soundproofing.** The walls were empty/thin enough to hear someone rolling over in bed between the bedrooms. :ear:
We added [Rockwool soundproofing insulation](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/ROCKWOOL-Safe-n-Sound-3-in-x-15-1-4-in-x-47-in-Soundproofing-and-Fire-Resistant-Stone-Wool-Insulation-Batt-59-7-sq-ft-RXSS31525/202531875)
on the leftmost wall (bordering the kitchen), followed by [1 lb mass loaded vinyl](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Technoflex-4-ft-x-10-ft-x-1-8-in-1-lb-Technowall-Mass-Loaded-Vinyl-Soundproofing-Barrier-Acoustic-Wall-MLV104810/325283436)
and finished up with [new plaster](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/plaster-vs-drywall-explained). 
The other interior (drywall) walls got 
[cellulose blown-in insulation](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Greenfiber-25-lbs-Cellulose-Blown-In-Insulation-or-Spray-Applied-Insulation-INSSANC/311574454). :hear_no_evil: :shushing_face:

**Step 2: Floor patching.** Matching the hardwood to patch the floor was the most annoying. 
Luckily, contractors who demoed the [upstairs closet to make space for our wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe)
pulled up some of the hardwood that we were able to patch in here.

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom02.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Step 3: (Re)painting.** Turns out, *plaster needs to cure*
before it can be painted, and [special primer](https://www.wickes.co.uk/Wickes-Trade-Matt-Emulsion-Paint-for-New-Plaster---Pure-Brilliant-White---10L/p/122443) needs to be used. Even [high quality painter's tape](https://www.frogtape.com/products/delicate-surface-painters-tape) will still 
rip off paint if the first paint coat doesn't cure long enough! *...Ask me how I know...* :roll_eyes: :woozy_face:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-paint.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## The Details

And now for the little projects that make this space feel like home! :blush:

### Bulletin Board

*Of course* a kid's room *needs* a [bulletin board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GYQ88L9)!! The basic wood frame
was too *grown-up* for a *6-year-old* (in my and his opinion), so I painted it with 
red acrylic paint and sealed it with 
polyurethane. :art: :artist: *How fun!*

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-bulletinboard.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
:point_up: *An aside, a [sturdy workbench](https://havenly.com/products/details/Workbench-Rolling-Workbenches-For-Garage-Adjustable-Height-Wayfair-143767843) 
is WAY more functional for art projects, crafts, and Lego building than a traditional desk. 
You can also adjust the height as kids grow and eventually use it for homework and/or a computer.*

### Switchplates

I'll admit... this was extra. :shrug: I used [Samplize peel-and-stick color swatches](https://samplize.com/products/lucerne-af-530-12x12?variant=39756341837926) to 
cover the switchplates and [cable covers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RZQXRQK) in [Benjamin Moore Lucerne](https://www.benjaminmoore.com/en-us/paint-colors/color/af-530/lucerne). 
I didn't need to sand/prime/paint anything, and we can easily change up the color (if ever needed).

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-switchplate01.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Ah, so satisfying... :lotus_position:

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-switchplate02.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![Kid Bedroom](../assets/img/kidbedroom-cablecover.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Hanging Planter 

Apparently [this fantastic color](https://vintageunscripted.com/10-decades-of-color-the-1970s/#:~:text=The%201970s%20was%20the%20first%20great%20houseplant%20collecting%20era) is *vintage 70s*, 
which I'm starting to realize is my favorite decade for design. ðŸª© :man_dancing:
The [macramÃ© hanger](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1269880196/no-tassel-macrame-plant-hanger-in-colors?variation0=2803425809&variation1=2836434719) was shorter than I expected, 
so I drilled holes through
some [wooden craft balls](https://www.michaels.com/product/wood-head-beads-by-creatology-10334889) and strung them onto the 
hanger.

### Glow-in-the-Dark Stars

I have to admit that the '90s had something going for it design-wise, though... [glow-in-the-dark stars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0085092R4)!!! :star: :star2: 
My kid *loves them*. Putting these up is not for the faint of heart; you have to stick adhesive putty on each one individually... :unamused: :face_exhaling:

### Dresser/Wardrobe

Stay tuned to see how I added handles to the wardrobe and arranged clothes into clothes bins!
