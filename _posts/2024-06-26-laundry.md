The phrase "tech debt" refers to the unavoidable cost of future maintenance or 
reworking of a (software) system where speed/hacks 
were prioritized over quality during development. 
Do we have a similar phrase for the time and energy expended when interacting with the catch-all "junk" spaces in our homes? 

Our laundry room doubles as a utility room where I stash my tools and house-related spare parts, but it turns out I could never find
what I needed when I needed it! We all know by now that I am not a fan of inefficiency. 

## The constraints
* On-demand water heater and water main filter cannot be blocked
* Everything must be labeled


*Details to come, but I'll leave you with some before-and-after shots for now!*
