Our (third floor walkup) condo has no entryway, no pantry, and a single hallway closet. This tiny 3'8"x3'3" closet is the 
*most utilized* square footage in our home and has an enormous number of functions to fulfill. 

![Closet](../assets/img/frontcloset07.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*The current setup was failing our family and desperately needed some intentional planning to improve.*

### Storage requirements
* coats
* hats, scarves, mittens
* kids' backpacks for daycare
* backstock and overflow (bulk) food
* oversized appliances and seldom-used cookware
* extra paper towels, sponges, trash bags
* folding chairs 
* stepstool
* broom, Swiffer, dustpan
* reusable plastic bags
* reusable grocery bags
* plastic bag recycling

### Kids' independently get and put away
* stepstool
* their own backpacks
* their own coats
* their own hats
* some food while helping in the kitchen

### Adults' (easy/fast) access requirements
* put groceries away 
* know what food we have and what we are running low on 
* access and put away ingredients while cooking 
* grab broom and dustpan for quick cleanup 
* pull out extra folding chairs for (sometimes spontaneous) guests

*That's a long list!* Space planning and optimization takes real effort, but the payoff is totally worth it for 
improving the efficiency of everyday life. Here's how our closet looks now:

*WOOO we checked off ALL of our requirements (so far)!*

## The Details

![Closet](../assets/img/frontcloset06.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*I hung the broom, dustpan, and Swiffer (used primarily to fish toy cars out from under couches) and a 
plastic bag dispenser directly on the back of the closet door.*

![Closet](../assets/img/frontcloset05.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
*Installed two [rows of hooks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TLX2Y75/) so that kids can reach the bottom level. These hooks fold back to save space and 
don't clobber your back when you're facing the other way. The stepstool is also accessible to our toddler and the folding chairs accessible for the grown-ups.*

**Bulk food storage** was essential during the pandemic when the grocery options were buy (1) a restaurant-supply quantity or (2) nothing. 
These days, we're using the bins for storing and organizing all sorts of dried goods, and they're great!
for storing and organizing dry goods of all varieties!*

**About the bins:** I cannot think of a more effective solution for being able to immediately see what we have (and what we're low on) 
than clear plastic bins. Also c'mon, don't you love my labels with the little ICONS?! The idea came to me for organizing my 3-year-old's stuff 
(since he can't read yet), but these seem to be easier for me (and random guests) to read, too!

**Reusable grocery bags:** Honestly it's easier to stuff them in a bin than actually hang 'em up, and we keep the large ones lined up on a mini shelf. 

**Plastic bag recycling:** Do you know the best/most intuitive spot for plastic bag recycling!? Me neither. This spot (in the pantry) was really our only option (I'll admit it). 
Seems to be working well so far at enabling us to put away packaging easily without getting in anyone's way in the kitchen!*

## Process and Cost

I explored *so many* organizer options before finally settling on the [Ikea Boaxel system](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/boaxel-system-47394/), because it seemed to maximize 
our specific space and included an option for a coat rod that did *not* span wall to wall. I also believe that having fully open shelves attached 
directly to the walls is optimal, since there are no vertical rods in front of the shelves to block your view, access, and storage flexibility. 
**The total cost for the entire shelving system was only $167** (plus $10.44 in tax and a drive to Stoughton for late-night pickup).
