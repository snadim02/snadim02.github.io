We recently moved our bedroom upstairs into a room that already functioned as 
an office :computer: :printer: 
*and* music room :banjo: :musical_keyboard: :accordion: :violin:. A dramatic reworking of the space was necessary
to accommodate these *triple utilities* while maintaining a calm, sleep-inducing retreat :bed: :sleeping:. 

**Jump ahead to see**
(1) the [transition from guest to master bedroom](#guest--master-bedroom-transition) :couch_and_lamp: :bed:,
(2) [office organization](#office-organization) :pencil: :pen:, and
(3) [music organization](#music-organization) :musical_score: :studio_microphone:.

## Guest â†’ Master Bedroom Transition

We originally had this side of the room set up as a guest bedroom with a [pullout sleeper sofa](https://www.americanleather.com/products/gaines/).

![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-officebefore.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

To transition this space into a master bedroom, we moved our actual bed upstairs
and the sleeper sofa [downstairs into the living room](../2025-04-12-living-room). :couch_and_lamp: :bed:

![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-after2.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Nightstands.** I sold the [old sofa side tables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BLVPG6BV) and 
[wall sconces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4J8V625) :bulb: and replaced them with 
a more practical [side cabinet](https://www.target.com/p/withania-2-door-cabinet-threshold-8482/-/A-89207299), 
[nightstand](https://www.overstock.com/products/safavieh-shyann-single-door-carved-nightstand-40656766?variant=61943056466079), 
and [swivel-arm wall sconces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087T4ZY8N) that we already owned.
I drilled a 1" hole into the back of the cabinet to hide the [surge protector power strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0721TYGVR) inside. :electric_plug:

**Aesthetic Accessories.** I organized my [jewelry and scarves](../2025-03-01-wardrobe/#organization) for easy access
since they didn't fit in our [custom wardrobe](../2025-03-01-wardrobe). :prayer_beads: :scarf: A bonus is that they look 
nice displayed like this, too! :framed_picture:

*And check out the view from bed!* :point_down:

![Master Bedroom](../assets/img/masterbed-after.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Not bad for functionally hiding office thingies 
to make the room feel like a peaceful bedroom retreat! :relieved: :sleeping:

## Office Organization

### The Desk
The **standing desk** *had* to go on the *only wall without a sloping ceiling*. 
:desktop_computer: :keyboard: :computer_mouse: I reduced
desktop clutter by installing [monitor posts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCLHMFGX) and 
[drilling](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/tools/power-tool-accessories/hole-saws/2029552) [grommet holes for wires](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G83N99D)
so that we wouldn't have to see [stressful work mess](https://www.housedigest.com/1438812/david-bromstad-hgtv-home-office-bedroom/) while trying to fall asleep. :relaxed: :see_no_evil:

![Picture of Standing Desk](../assets/img/masterbed-desk.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### The Printers
I hid the [**3D printer**](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-mini-semi-assembled-3d-printer-4/) inside 
the [sideboard](https://www.wayfair.com/organization-storage/pdp/loon-peak-bettye-1-drawer-credenza-w004342388.html) 
on a slide-out printer tray blocked with [cafe curtains](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLGTVHPF). :ninja: :star_struck:

![Master Bedroom 3D Printer](../assets/img/masterbed-3dprinter.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
:point_up: *The printer works perfectly while tucked away, and the curtain [blocks drafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1agk4aw/is_there_any_problem_of_leaving_my_3d_printer_in/), too!*

Our regular **laserjet printer** is also hidden in the middle section of the side table, 
and I arranged my paper types for easier DIY labeling. :printer:

![Master Bedroom Hidden Printer](../assets/img/masterbed-hiddenprinter.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### File Storage

I whittled down an enormous 2-drawer file cabinet of junk (...rental leases from college? [No thanks](https://shiragill.com/paperwork-organization-simplified/).)
into this single crate. :file_cabinet:

![Master Bedroom File Crate](../assets/img/masterbed-files.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Office Supplies

Our other office supplies are organized and 
labeled in the top drawer of the office credenza (using these [fantastic interlocking drawer organizers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DAQ73P0)) and in the
[bedside cabinet](https://www.target.com/p/withania-2-door-cabinet-threshold-8482/-/A-89207299) (using these [clear bins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DFBSTFR), which I also use for [toy organization](../2022-12-30-toys)). :pen: :pencil: :notebook:

![Master Bedroom Office Supplies](../assets/img/masterbed-officesupplies.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## Music Organization

You probably [saw](#guest--master-bedroom-transition) the banjo :banjo: and digital piano :musical_keyboard: already. 

![Master Bedroom Digital Piano](../assets/img/masterbed-music1.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I found a [stand for our digital piano on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1664543133/mid-century-modern-piano-keyboard-stand) (*not* that I recommend it) and a [piano bench](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BJ4DW86)
to store music in these [sheet music organizers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R8SW845). 

![Master Bedroom Sheet Music](../assets/img/masterbed-sheetmusic.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

:eyes: What you *didn't see* was the recording equipment :studio_microphone: :headphones:, amplifier :radio: and ukelele
that are now stored in the bedside tables 
out of sight (but within reach). The accordion and keyboard travel case fit under the bed :accordion: :musical_keyboard:!


## Cost

I originally prettied-up this office in 2023 after I moved my [workspace out to the loft](../2023-06-01-fireplace). 
Here are prices for the *new* design for our master bedroom, but I include costs from the former redesign separately below.
