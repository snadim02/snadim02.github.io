In engineering (and design), geometric constraints refer to limitations on a single entity :door: (size, location) 
and dependencies on pairs of entities :door:&#x2194:couch_and_lamp: (distance, arc angle). Our laundry room was a 
great exercise in satisfying geometric constraints!

![layout](../assets/img/laundry-layout.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

## The Constraints

* [Door frame](#step-1-french-doors) :door:
  * unmovable, 32" wide opening
* [Premade cabinet](#step-2-premade-cabinet) :package: :file_cabinet: :toolbox:
  * 24x24x90" (in a 93" tall room)
  * 2" buffer from wall for recessed outlet
* [Stacked washer/dryer](#step-3-custom-cabinetry-built-ins) :basket: :soap:
  * overflow drain pipe is in the floor
  * dryer ducting overlaps cabinet
* [Storage](#step-4-organization-star_struck) 
  * accessible laundry supplies
  * space for bulky bedding

## The Process

### Step 1: French Doors

![layout](../assets/img/laundry16.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The narrowest manufactured French doors are 48" wide, so I installed 32" wide [bifold window doors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TYVGGL4) instead.
The two 16" door slabs swing open with [3.5" hinges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071VY5BQH/) and stay shut with [ball catch hardware](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009E1X39Q/).

| Challenge | Solution | 
| --- | --- | 
| :evergreen_tree: Doors are unfinished. | :heavy_check_mark: Pine was sanded, primed, sanded, and painted twice! :woman_artist: | 
| :door: Unused bifold track shortened door slabs by 1.5". | :heavy_check_mark: Added strips of wood to the top of the door frame to fill the gap. | 
| :hole: Standard door knob bore holes (2 1/8") don't fit. | :heavy_check_mark: Installed [antique mortise-style door knobs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B74STSV9) instead. |
| :bulb: Interior light switch is now blocked. | :heavy_check_mark: Relocated switch to hallway using a [wireless receiver kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09YHBHP8T/). | 

![layout](../assets/img/laundry19.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Step 2: Premade Ikea Pantry Cabinet

I used a [premade 24x24x90" Ikea Sektion cabinet](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sektion-high-cabinet-frame-white-70265445/) 
because of the flexibility for shelves and cabinet doors. 

| Challenge | Solution | 
| --- | --- | 
| :ladder: Cabinet is 90" high in a 93" high room. | :heavy_check_mark: Build a 3" base instead of standard 4.5" legs |
| :electric_plug: Regular outlet is inaccessible. | :heavy_check_mark: Leave 2" gap from wall to fit an [interior recessed outlet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL6LYZ6L/). |
| :no_entry_sign: Dryer plug point is blocked. | :heavy_check_mark: Install a [removable access panel](https://www.homedepot.com/p/VENTS-US-8-5-8-in-x-11-3-4-in-Plastic-Access-Panel-D250X300/205728949). |
| :carpentry_saw: Dryer vent ducting overlaps cabinet. | :heavy_check_mark: Cut cabinet to accommodate! | 
| :closed_lock_with_key: 9x9x3" security box blocks cabinet front. | :heavy_check_mark: Install [shorter cabinet doors](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/enkoeping-door-white-wood-effect-50505936/). |

![layout](../assets/img/laundry17.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![layout](../assets/img/laundry22.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Half cabinet access.** The doors to the room must be fully open when I'm entering and exiting with a laundry basket.
Luckily, Ikea makes [12" wide cabinet doors](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/enkoeping-door-white-wood-effect-50505936/), 
so I can access the left half of the cabinet (and pull out [this 9" organizer](https://www.simplehuman.com/products/pull-out-cabinet-organizer-9-inch))
even with the French doors open!

![layout](../assets/img/laundry20.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**Inside-cabinet outlet.** Thanks to our [recessed outlet extension](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL6LYZ6L), our 
[handheld vacuum](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08559K2DL) finally has a home! 
I filled the predrilled [shelf peg holes with removable plastic plugs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBB2LX37) to 
allow for shelf height switch-ups later on as needed.

![layout](../assets/img/laundry21.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

### Step 3: Custom Cabinetry Built-Ins

I hired a carpenter to finish the custom cabinet above the stacked washer/dryer before the start of the school year. 
Rather than moving the washer/dryer out of the room beforehand, they built cabinetry around the appliances in place,
which led to some foreseeable problems... 

:fire: **Problem 1: The dryer smells like fire!**
> The evening that my carpenter left, I tried to dry a wet floor towel (that our kiddo had dumped bath water onto). 
A *horrible burning smell and steam started to fill the room!* :scream: :fire_extinguisher: :woman_firefighter: :safety_vest:

I called the [Dryer Vent Wizards](https://www.dryerventwizard.com/locations/greater-boston) (highly recommend!), and they found
and fixed a couple of problems the next morning... 

![layout](../assets/img/laundry23.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

![layout](../assets/img/laundry24.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Unfortunately, this led to another new problem...

:ocean: **Problem 2: The washer is leaking!**

> Because the washer/dryer are screwed together in the back
> and could not be lifted without damaging the cabinets, 
> we needed to pull the connected units straight out, which 
> destroyed the drip pan front lip. :weary: 
> Our washer (like many older, "high efficiency" load-sensing units) sometimes 
has an [excess suds overflow leak](https://www.thespruce.com/why-is-my-washing-machine-leaking-2147313#toc-front-load-washer-leaks). :bathtub: :bucket:
We live in a 3rd-floor condo, and I panicked seeing water all over the floor! 

Getting a new drip pan in there was tricky!

| Idea! :bulb: | Womp Womp | 
| --- | --- | 
| move the washer/dryer in separately | :x: connection is in the back | 
| drop them in together | :x: no vertical clearance |
| slide them in with the drip pan underneath | :x: drain pipe sticks out of the floor |

![layout](../assets/img/laundry25.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

**My solution!** :muscle: :sassy_woman:
1. Cut the front off a [new appliance drip pan](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Oatey-28-in-x-30-in-Plastic-Washing-Machine-Pan-with-1-in-Furnished-Drain-Adapter-34067/100080446), [predrill drain hole](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/tools/power-tool-accessories/hole-saws/2029552), and install it around drain pipe first. 
2. Slide the stacked washer/dryer into place over drip pan. 
3. Cut *another* new drip pan to get front lip + 6". 
4. Lift the front of washer/dryer with [manual jacks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CH33RLV1/) and push new drip pan front into place. 
5. [Duct-tape](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-6025302-White-Tough-Wide/dp/B07LFZF9KN/) the drip pan halves together and seal with [clear silicone caulk](https://www.amazon.com/Gorilla-Waterproof-Silicone-Sealant-Squeeze/dp/B09X7G4V63).

### Step 4: Organization :star_struck:

I always planned for the cabinetry in this room to store 
extra comforters (for guests) :sleeping_bed:, 
specialty recycling
([textiles](https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/textilesrecycling), [electronics](https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/publicworks/Services/recyclingcenter)) :recycle:, 
[donations](https://www.facebook.com/groups/571919200610635), 
extra air filters :mask:, tissues :sneezing_face: and toilet paper :roll_of_paper:. 
I also now hide wrapped gifts in the top shelf bins :gift: :shushing_face:.

![layout](../assets/img/laundry26.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

I found these [extra-deep cloth bins](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087MVST5P), [bin clip labels](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WJ1M7V8),
and fantastic [compact dry racks](https://www.containerstore.com/s/closet/laundry-room-accessories/compact-accordion-clothes-drying-rack/12d?productId=11004508), all of which are working out perfectly in this 24" wide cabinet!

Check out how I finished the [utility half of the laundry room](../2024-06-26-laundry/), too! Feels great to have this tiny and (now) amazingly functional room complete!
