title: Refactoring Reality
subtitle: optimizing life with computational thinking
---

**The backstory.** Part of what draws me to Computer Science is my general love of thinking about optimal solutions given a set of 
constraints. I like playing strategy board games, planning routes to minimize travel time and distance, and packing *exactly* without excess. 
Part of what draws me to research is my general love of experimenting with (and measuring the success of) new ideas.
Unrelated: I'm also sensitive to visual overcrowding and cannot concentrate when my surroundings are messy or disorganized.

**The catalyst.** Enter two baby boys across [three](https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/why-we-need-to-talk-about-losing-a-baby) [rough pregnancies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperemesis_gravidarum) 
during my postdoc and a worldwide pandemic imprisoning our family of 4 in a tiny urban apartment 
*with no childcare options or any outside help for more than half a year*. 
You get it. [Maybe](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/covid-19-pandemic-forcing-millennial-mothers-workforce/).

**The outcome.** Planning, executing, and iteratively refactoring organization solutions to enable everyone in the family to 
*independently find and use their stuff* safely and *put it away themselves* was essential for life but also, turns out, an essential form of selfcare for me. 
Now, friends and family are so delighted by some of my systems that they've encouraged me to charge other people to organize their spaces! 
Not interested (yet). But I am excited to share ideas!
